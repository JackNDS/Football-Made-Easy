        legitimate interests, which are further explained in the section “How We
        Use the Information We Collect” of this Policy. We may also process data
        upon your consent, asking for it as appropriate.

        geographic area or preferences, when any such information is linked to
        information that identifies a specific individual. You may provide us
        with Personal Data in various ways on the Service. For example, when you

        <span2>2.4 Integrated Services.</span2>You may be given the option to
        access or register for the Service through the use of your user name and

        profile picture URL, and other information that the Integrated Service
        makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with
        this Policy. You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated
        Service to understand what information that Integrated Service makes
        available to us, and make changes as appropriate. Please review each
        Integrated Service’s terms of use and privacy policies carefully before
        using their services and connecting to our Service.
      </p>
      <p class="terms-paragraph">
        <span2>2.5 Information from Other Sources.</span2>
        We may obtain information, including Personal Data, from third parties
        and sources other than the Service, such as our partners, advertisers,
        credit rating agencies, and Integrated Services. If we combine or
        associate information from other sources with Personal Data that we
        collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as
        Personal Data in accordance with this Policy.
      </p>
      <div class="paragraph-heading">HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</div>
      <p class="terms-paragraph">
        We use the information that we collect in a variety of ways in providing
        the Service and operating our business, including the following:
        <br /><br />3.1 Operations<br />
        We use the information – other than User Data - to operate, maintain,
        enhance and provide all features of the Service, to provide the services
        and information that you request, to respond to comments and questions
        and to provide support to users of the Service. We process User Data
        solely in accordance with the directions provided by the applicable
        User. <br /><br />3.2 Improvements<br />
        We use the information to understand and analyze the usage trends and
        preferences of our Visitors and Users, to improve the Service, and to
        develop new products, services, feature, and functionality. Should this
        purpose require Sideline to process User Data, then the data will only
        be used in anonymized or aggregated form. <br /><br />3.3
        Communications<br />
        We may use a Visitor’s or User’s email address or other information –
        other than User Data – to contact that Visitor or User (i) for
        administrative purposes such as customer service, to address
        intellectual property infringement, right of privacy violations or
        defamation issues related to the User Data or Personal Data posted on
        the Service or (ii) with updates on promotions and events, relating to
        products and services offered by us and by third parties we work with.
        You have the ability to opt-out of receiving any promotional
        communications as described below under “Your Choices.” <br /><br />3.4
        Cookies and Tracking Technologies<br />
        We use automatically collected information and other information
        collected on the Service through cookies and similar technologies to:
        (i) personalize our Service, such as remembering a User’s or Visitor’s
        information so that the User or Visitor will not have to re-enter it
        during a visit or on subsequent visits; (ii) provide customized
        advertisements, content, and information; (iii) monitor and analyze the
        effectiveness of Service and third-party marketing activities; (iv)
        monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors
        and pages viewed; and (v) track your entries, submissions, and status in
        any promotions or other activities on the Service. You can obtain more
        information about cookies by visiting http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
        <br /><br />3.5 Analytics<br />
        We use Google Analytics to measure and evaluate access to and traffic on
        the Public Area of the Site, and create user navigation reports for our
        Site administrators. Google operates independently from us and has its
        own privacy policy, which we strongly suggest you review. Google may use
        the information collected through Google Analytics to evaluate Users'
        and Visitors’ activity on our Site. For more information, see Google
        Analytics Privacy and Data Sharing. We take measures to protect the
        technical information collected by our use of Google Analytics. The data
        collected will only be used on a need to know basis to resolve technical
        issues, administer the Site and identify visitor preferences; but in
        this case, the data will be in non-identifiable form. We do not use any
        of this information to identify Visitors or Users.
      </p>
      <div class="paragraph-heading">4. TO WHOM WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION</div>
      <p class="terms-paragraph">
        Except as described in this Policy, we will not intentionally disclose
        the Personal Data or Client Data that we collect or store on the Service

        Providers<br />
        We work with third party service providers who provide website,
        application development, hosting, maintenance, and other services for
        us. These third parties may have access to, or process Personal Data or
        User Data as part of providing those services for us. We limit the
        information provided to these service providers to that which is
        reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions, and our
        contracts with them require them to maintain the confidentiality of such
        information. <br /><br />4.3 Non Personally Identifiable Information<br />We
        may make certain automatically-collected, aggregated, or otherwise

      </p>
      <div class="paragraph-heading">5. YOUR CHOICES</div>
      <p class="terms-paragraph">
        5.1 Access, Correction, Deletion<br />
        We respect your privacy rights and provide you with reasonable access to
        the Personal Data that you may have provided through your use of the
        Services. If you wish to access or amend any other Personal Data we hold
        about you, or to request that we delete or transfer any information
        about you that we have obtained from an Integrated Service, you may
        contact us as set forth in the “How to Contact Us” section. At your
        request, we will have any reference to you deleted or blocked in our
        database. You may update, correct, or delete your Account information
        and preferences at any time by accessing your Profile settings tab in
        the desktop software and, to some extent, in your Profile section in the
        apps. Please note that while any changes you make will be reflected in
        active user databases instantly or within a reasonable period of time,
        we may retain all information you submit for backups, archiving,
        prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal
        obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a
        legitimate reason to do so. You may decline to share certain Personal
        Data with us, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some of
        the features and functionality of the Service. At any time, you may
        object to the processing of your Personal Data, on legitimate grounds,
        except if otherwise permitted by applicable law. If you believe your
        right to privacy granted by applicable data protection laws has been
        infringed upon, please contact FME’s Data Protection Officer at
        me@footballmadeeasy.com.au . You also have a right to lodge a complaint
        with data protection authorities. This provision does not apply to
        Personal Data that is part of User Data. In this case, the management of
        the User Data is subject to the User’s own Privacy Policy, and any
        request for access, correction or deletion should be made to the User
        responsible for the uploading and storage of such data into the Service.
        <br /><br />5.2 Navigation Information <br />You may opt out from the
        collection of navigation information about your visit to the Site by
        Google Analytics by using Google Analytics Opt-out feature.
        <br /><br />5.3 Opting out from Commercial Communications<br />
        If you receive commercial emails from us, you may unsubscribe at any
        time by following the instructions contained within the email or by
        sending an email to the address provided in the “How to Contact Us”
        section. Users are able to view and modify settings relating to
        promotional communications that they receive from us by accessing the
        Privacy tab in the SETTINGS of the desktop program. Please be aware that
        if you opt-out of receiving commercial email from us or otherwise modify
        the nature or frequency of promotional communications you receive from
        us, it may take up to ten (10) business days for us to process your
        request. Additionally, even after you opt-out from receiving commercial
        messages from us, you will continue to receive administrative messages
        from us regarding the Service. FME has no direct relationship with the
        User’s customers or third party whose Personal Data it may process on
        behalf of a User unless they have been created with a license that
        allows them to log on. An individual (for example, an athlete that is
        being profiled by a trainer) who seeks access, or who seeks to correct,
        amend, delete inaccurate data or withdraw consent for further contact
        should direct his or her query to the User they deal with directly. If
        the User requests FME to remove the data, we will respond to its request
        within thirty (30) days. We will delete, amend or block access to any
        Personal Data that we are storing only if we receive a written request
        to do so from the User who is responsible for such Personal Data, unless
        we have a legal right to retain such Personal Data. We reserve the right
        to retain a copy of such data for archiving purposes, or to defend our
        rights in litigation. Any such request regarding User Data should be
        addressed as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section, and include
        sufficient information for FME to identify the User or its customer or
        third party and the information to delete or amend.

      <div class="paragraph-heading">6. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</div>
      <p class="terms-paragraph">
        The Service may contain features or links to web sites and services
        provided by third parties. Any information you provide on third-party
        sites or services is provided directly to the operators of such services
        and is subject to those operators’ policies, if any, governing privacy
        and security, even if accessed through the Service. We are not
        responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and
        policies of third-party sites or services to which links or access are
        provided through the Service. We encourage you to learn about third
        parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with
        information.
      </p>
      <div class="paragraph-heading">7. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS</div>
      <p class="terms-paragraph">
        We will not share any Personal Data with third-parties for their direct
        marketing purposes to the extent prohibited by law. If our practices
        change, we will do so in accordance with applicable laws and will notify
        you in advance.
      </p>
      <div class="paragraph-heading">8. INTEREST BASED ADVERTISING</div>
      <p class="terms-paragraph">
        Interest based advertising is the collection of data from different
        sources and across different platforms in order to predict an
        individual’s preferences or interest and to deliver to that individual,
        or his/her computer, smart phone or tablet, advertising based on his/her
        assumed preference or interest inferred from the collection of data
        pertaining to that individual or others who may have a similar profile
        or similar interests. We work with a variety of third parties to attempt
        to understand the profiles of the individuals who are most likely to be
        interested in the Sideline products or services so that we can send them
        promotional emails, or serve our advertisements to them on the websites
        and mobile apps of other entities. These third parties include: (a)
        advertising networks, which collect information about a person’s
        interests when that person views or interacts with one of their
        advertisements; (2) attribution partners, which measure the
        effectiveness of certain advertisements; and (3) business partners,
        which collect information when a person views or interacts with one of
        their advertisements. In collaboration with these third parties, we
        collect information about our customers, prospects and other individuals
        over time and across different platforms when they use these platforms
        or interact with them. Individuals may submit information directly on
        our Sites or on platforms run by third parties, or by interacting with
        us, our advertisements, or emails they receive from us or from third
        parties. We may use special tools that are commonly used for this
        purpose, such as cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, mobile advertising IDs,
        flash cookies, and similar technologies. We may have access to databases
        of information collected by our business partners. The information we or
        third party collect enables us to learn what purchases the person made,
        what ads or content the person sees, on which ads or links the person
        clicks, and other actions that the person takes on our Sites, or in
        response to our emails, or when visiting or using third parties’
        platforms. We, or the third parties with which we work, use the
        information collected as described above to understand the various
        activities and behaviors of our customers, Site visitors and others. We,
        or these third parties, do this for many reasons, including: to
        recognize new or past visitors to our Sites; to present more
        personalized content; to provide more useful and relevant ads - for
        example, if we know what ads you are shown we can try not to show you
        the same ones repeatedly; to identify visitors across devices, sales
        channels, third party websites and Sites, or to display or send
        personalized or targeted ads and other custom content that is more
        focused on a person’s perceived interest in products or services similar
        to those that we offer. Our interest-based ads may be served to you in
        emails or on third-party platforms. We may serve these ads about our
        products or services or send commercial communications directly
        ourselves or through these third parties.

        <br /><br />Visitors may opt out of receiving interest based advertising
        by advertising networks that may be delivered to them on our platform
        and other websites by visiting the following websites:
        <span>http://www.aboutads.info/consumers </span> and
        <span>http://www.networkadvertising.org</span>. These features will opt

      <div class="paragraph-heading">9. DO NOT TRACK POLICY</div>
      <p class="terms-paragraph">
        Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of these
        features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the website or
        online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not
        wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of
        how to interpret Do Not Track signals, we do not currently respond to Do
        Not Track signal. We continue to work with the online industry to define
        a common understanding of how to treat Do Not Track signals. In the
        meantime, you may opt out of receiving interest based advertising from
        advertising networks that may be delivered on our platform and other
        websites by visiting the following websites. If you want to opt out of
        this online behavioural advertising, visit the following sites:
        <span>http://www.aboutads.info/consumers</span> and
        <span>http://www.networkadvertising.org</span>. <br />This will opt you
        out of many – but not all - of the interest-based advertising activities
        in which we or third parties engage. Choices you make may be browser and
        device specific. If you delete your cookies or use a different browser
        or a different computer or device, you may need to update your opt-out
        choices. Other third-party Sites provide visitors with the ability to
        opt-out of receiving interest-based ads on their Sites that you need to
        control through your settings on that Site. For example, to opt out of
        Google’s use of your online behavior for advertising purposes, visit
        Google’s Ad Settings page.

      <div class="paragraph-heading">10. THIRD PARTY COOKIE</div>
      <p class="terms-paragraph">
        We allow third parties with which we have a separate agreement to use
        cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of
        the Site. These third parties include (1) business partners, which

        information about your interests when you view or interact with one of

        on other sites across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.
        The business partners and advertising networks that serve interest-based
        advertisements on the Services have limited access to a small amount of
        information about your profile and your device, which is necessary to

        other sites or services. We do not share with these third parties any
        information that would readily identify you (such as email address);
        however, these third parties may have access to information about your

        third parties are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Other than as
        discussed in this document, we have no control over these third parties.

      <div class="paragraph-heading">11. MINORS AND CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</div>
      <p class="terms-paragraph">
        Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Our
        Service is not directed to children under the age of 16, and we do not
        knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 16
        without obtaining parental consent. If you are under 16 years of age,
        then please do not use or access the Service at any time without a
        permission from a custodian. If you are a parent or guardian and
        discover that your child under 16 years of age has obtained an Account
        on the Service, then you may alert us at me@footballmadeeasy.com.au and
        request that we delete that child’s Personal Data from our systems. The
        Service is not intended to be used by minors, and is not intended to be
        used to post content to share publicly or with friends. To the extent
        that a minor has posted such content on the Service, the minor has the
        right to have this content deleted or removed using the deletion or
        removal options detailed in this Privacy Policy. If you have any
        question regarding this topic, please contact us as indicated in the
        “How to Contact Us” section. Please be aware that, although we offer
        this deletion capability, the removal of content may not ensure complete
        or comprehensive removal of that content or information.
      </p>
      <div class="paragraph-heading">12. DATA SECURITY</div>
      <p class="terms-paragraph">
        We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the
        information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we
        receive it. We maintain appropriate administrative, technical and
        physical safeguards to protect Personal Data against accidental or
        unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration,
        unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form
        of processing of the Personal Data in our possession. This includes, for
        example, firewalls, password protection and other access and
        authentication controls. We use SSL technology to encrypt data during
        transmission through public internet, and we also employ
        application-layer security features to further anonymise Personal Data.
        However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
        electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the
        security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service,
        and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such
        information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by
        breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If
        you believe your Personal Data has been compromised, please contact us
        as set forth in the “How to Contact Us” section. If we learn of a
        security systems breach, we will inform you and the authorities of the
        occurrence of the breach in accordance with applicable law.

      <div class="paragraph-heading">13. DATA RETENTION</div>
      <p class="terms-paragraph">
        We do not delete Personal Data or User Data when a license expires.
        Trainers frequently change jobs and go to a club that does not use FME
        Services for some years and then start working for another club that use
        FME Services again. That is why we keep accounts open although Users do
        not pay for licenses. To properly deactivate an account, you have to
        contact us and ask for deactivation as set forth in the “How to Contact
        Us” section. We delete deactivated account within 6 months of
        deactivation. If we restore backups, we delete deactivated accounts from
        the restored data. <br />We will retain and use information as necessary
        to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
        agreements as follows: <br />
        13.1 the contents of closed accounts are deleted within 3 months of the
        date of closure; <br />
        13.2 backups are kept for 5-52 weeks: (databases: 5 weeks, Game Exchange
        videos: 31 day, html content: 365 days); <br />
        13.3 billing information is retained <br />
        13.4 information on legal transactions between User and Sideline is
        retained <br />Other retained data: <br />
        13.1 Templates (metadata and reference data) that you have shared with
        other Users and they have used, will not cause their data to disappear.
        <br />
        13.2 If you create a new User with a license you paid for and the User
        logs on, the User is considered a separate User and not your User Data
        and you can no longer delete that User or the User Data he/she may have
        created.

        measures are perfect or impenetrable. We are not responsible for
        circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on the

        The Service is hosted by Amazon Web Services in Germany. HTML content,
        images, videos (including Game Exchange) is hosted by Amazon Web
        Services in Frankfurt and Ireland for European residents but also in

        Data outside of those regions to the European Union for storage and

        16. DATA CONTROLLER AND DATA PROCESSOR
      </div>
      <p class="terms-paragraph">
        Sideline does not own, control or direct the use of any of the User Data
        stored or processed by a User via the Service. Only the Users are
        entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such User Data. FME
        is largely unaware of what User Data is actually being stored or made
        available by a User to the Service and does not directly access such
        User Data except as authorized by the User, or as necessary to provide
        Services to the User and its connected Users. Because FME does not
        collect or determine the use of any Personal Data contained in the User
        Data and because it does not determine the purposes for which such
        Personal Data is collected, the means of collecting such Personal Data,
        or the uses of such Personal Data, FME is not acting in the capacity of
        data controller in terms of the European Union’s General Data Protection
        Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, hereinafter “GDPR”) and does not
        have the associated responsibilities under the GDPR. FME should be
        considered only as a processor on behalf of its Users as to any User
        Data containing Personal Data that is subject to the requirements of the
        GDPR. Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, FME does not
        independently cause User Data containing Personal Data stored in
        connection with the Services to be transferred or otherwise made
        available to third parties, except to third party subcontractors who may
        process such data on behalf of FME in connection with FME’s provision of
        Services to Users. Such actions are performed or authorized only by the
        applicable User. The User is the data controller under the Regulation
        for any User Data containing Personal Data, meaning that such party
        controls the manner such Personal Data is collected and used as well as
        the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such
        Personal Data. FME is not responsible for the content of the Personal
        Data contained in the User Data or other information stored on its
        servers (or its subcontractors’ servers) at the discretion of the User
        nor is FME responsible for the manner in which the User collects,
        handles disclosure, distributes or otherwise processes such information.
